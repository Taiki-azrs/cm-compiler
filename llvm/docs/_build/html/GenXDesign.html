<p>The GenX backend for LLVM targets Intel HD Graphics, and represents EU code in
such a way that it represents the full functionality of an EU thread, such as
region addressing and SIMD control flow.</p>
<p>For more introductory material on the GenX backend, see <a class="reference internal" href="GenXIntro.html"><span class="doc">Introduction to the GenX backend</span></a>.</p>
<p>This document does not cover the design of the Clang-based front end of the CM
compiler. Assuming you are reading this in a cm-llvm source tree where you have
built the documentation,

<h3>Users of the GenX backend<a class="headerlink" href="#users-of-the-genx-backend" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Currently the only user of the GenX backend is the CM compiler (the cm-llvm
project).</p>
<p>The GenX backend is designed to stand alone from the CM compiler, so it could be
used in other projects that require its whole-EU-thread representation. See the
section <em>Whole thread representation</em> in <a class="reference internal" href="GenXLangRef.html"><span class="doc">LLVM IR for the GenX backend</span></a>.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">Not using the LLVM target independent code generator</a><a class="headerlink" href="#not-using-the-llvm-target-independent-code-generator" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<img alt="_images/GenXDesign_typical_llvm.png" src="_images/GenXDesign_typical_llvm.png" />
<p>Most LLVM targets use the target independent code generator. It mostly uses a
textual machine description that is compiled by tablegen as part of the build
process.</p>
<p>Using that machine description, the target converts the LLVM IR into a DAG form,
legalizes and instruction selects it, runs a pre-RA scheduler, and converts it
into <em>machine IR</em>, which starts off as SSA, but is de-SSAd as part of the
register allocation process.</p>
<div class="section" id="disadvantages-of-the-target-independent-code-generator">
<h3>Disadvantages of the target independent code generator<a class="headerlink" href="#disadvantages-of-the-target-independent-code-generator" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The target independent code generator has a number of problems:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>We get lots of problems with the assumption that the target is a
real CPU with real hardregs, when in fact we are targeting vISA with an
effectively infinite number of registers.</li>
<li>Even if we were targeting Gen directly, rather than vISA, the target
independent code generator would not cope with Gen’s almost byte addressable
register file. Although it can cope with different size registers mapping to
the same place, they have to be hierarchical (e.g. rax contains eax contains
ax contains al and ah).</li>
<li>In machine IR, an operand does not carry a type, only a register
class. Instead the instruction implies the type (e.g. “add i32”). For the ALU
ops, even though types are limited to a power of two number of elements limited
to 32 bytes, we would have quite a few combinations, especially as GenX allows
the source and destination to be different type and signedness. It is worse for
one operand in a memory access or region access; such an operand can be any
number of elements almost up to the entire register file size.</li>
<li>The vector width legalization carried out on the DAG in the target independent
code generator is nothing like what we want for region and operand
legalization.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-alternative-use-llvm-ir">
<h3>The alternative: use LLVM IR<a class="headerlink" href="#the-alternative-use-llvm-ir" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<img alt="_images/GenXDesign_GenX_llvm.png" src="_images/GenXDesign_GenX_llvm.png" />
<p>The GenX backend does not use the target independent code generator. Instead it
keeps the program in LLVM IR and operates on that, right up to the vISA writer
at the end. It uses LLVM IR in conjunction with other on-the-side data
structures, as is normal with LLVM passes. (For example, LLVM keeps the
dominator tree as a separate on-the-side data structure.)</p>
<p>The GenX backend does have to jump through some hoops to use this approach:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A single vISA instruction is represented in the LLVM IR by multiple
instructions, with an on-the-side data structure, <em>baling info</em>, saying how
the instructions are grouped together into <em>bales</em>.</li>
<li>The LLVM IR continues to be SSA, even after the pass (GenXCoalescing) that
effectively does the de-SSA. This works because GenXCoalescing inserts copies
to implement the phi nodes, but in such a way that the phi nodes are still
present. The on-the-side data structure describing liveness and how values
are coalesced ensures that the operands and result of a particular phi node
will be in the same register.</li>
</ul>
<p>(Both IGC and Beignet avoid the target independent code generator too, but use
the slightly different approach of having their own non-SSA IR after LLVM IR.)</p>

<h3>Restricting the LLVM IR through the GenX backend<a class="headerlink" href="#restricting-the-llvm-ir-through-the-genx-backend" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Although the GenX backend uses LLVM IR throughout, what can be represented
becomes more and more restricted as the IR is fed through the passes, until,
at the end, the GenXVisaFuncWriter pass is able to translate the LLVM IR
(together with baling information and register allocation) trivially into
vISA.</p>
<p>In the pass documentation below, an LLVM IR restriction is flagged like this:

<h3>Constant folding, instruction simplification and instruction combining changes<a class="headerlink" href="#constant-folding-instruction-simplification-and-instruction-combining-changes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In LLVM, <em>constant folding</em> is where an instruction has all constant operands,
and uses of it are replaced by the computed constant result. <em>Instruction simplification</em>
is where a tree of one or more instructions
can be replaced by one of the operands or a constant.
<em>Instruction combining</em> is where a tree of one or more
instructions can be replaced by a new instruction.</p>
<p>GenX intrinsics participate in constant folding and instruction simplification
but not in instruction combining.</p>

<p>This section documents some GenX backend classes and abstractions that are not

<div class="section" id="genx-alignmentinfo-alignment-information">
<h3>genx::AlignmentInfo : alignment information<a class="headerlink" href="#genx-alignmentinfo-alignment-information" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>AlignmentInfo is a cache of information on the alignment of instruction
values in a function. It does not persist between passes.</p>
<p>A pass that needs alignment information constructs an AlignmentInfo at
the start of the pass, and then calls the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">get</span></code> method each time it wants
alignment information for a particular instruction value. AlignmentInfo
calculates it if it is not already in its cache, which probably involves
also calculating the alignment of other instructions that the given one
depends on.</p>
<p>This cacheing and lazy calculation is done instead of having a separate analysis
pass because alignment is needed for only a small subset of values in a function.</p>
<p>The alignment is returned as an <em>Alignment</em> object with three fields:
<em>ConstBits</em>, if ConstBits is not 0x7fffffff, alignment is a known bit-pattern,
otherwise <em>LogAlign</em> and <em>ExtraBits</em> (where 0 &lt;= ExtraBits &lt; (1 &lt;&lt; LogAlign)),
stating that the value is known to be A &lt;&lt; LogAlign | ExtraBits for some A.</p>
<p>For a vector value, the alignment information is for element 0.</p>
<p>The calculation uses a worklist algorithm that can cope with phi nodes and
loops. So, for example, a variable (used as an indirect region index) that
starts at 10 then is incremented by 8 inside a loop is correctly calculated
to be 8A+2 for some A.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="genxregion-region-information">
<h3>GenXRegion : region information<a class="headerlink" href="#genxregion-region-information" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Refer to the comments in the base class CMRegion defined in
llvm/Transform/Scalar.</p>
<p>Function added for the GenXRegion</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Construct from a rdregion/wrregion intrinsic, setting the GenXRegion
to the region described by the intrinsic. This constructor also takes the
BaleInfo as an argument, allowing a variable index that is a baled in
constant add to be considered as a separate variable index and constant
offset.</li>
</ul>
<p>GenXLegalization uses GenXRegion to determine whether a region is legal,
and split it up if necessary. First it constructs a GenXRegion, then it
has a loop to split it into legal regions. Each loop iteration calls:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the getLegalSize method (see below) to determine the split size; then</li>
<li>getSubregion to modify the GenXRegion for the split size; then</li>
<li>one of the methods to create a new rdregion or wrregion intrinsic.</li>

<h4>GenXRegion::getLegalSize<a class="headerlink" href="#genxregion-getlegalsize" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">getLegalSize</span></code> method is used by GenXLegalization and some other
passes to determine whether a region is legal, and if not how small
a split is required to make it legal.</p>
<p>It takes the GenXSubtarget as an argument, because it needs to know
architecture-specific details, currently just whether a single GRF
crossing is allowed in an indirect region.</p>
<p>It also takes either an AlignmentInfo object, or the actual alignment
of the indirect index (if any). Knowing the alignment of the indirect
index can help allow a larger legal region, and avoid needing to split
into simd1.</p>

<p>GenXReduceIntSize is a function pass that reduces the size of vector int
values where it can.</p>
<p>The semantics of the source language usually involve an operator such as +
promoting its operands before performing the calculation. Typically, the
front end compiler generates IR for the promotion without bothering to work
out if it is unnecessary, as it is easier to work out if it is unnecessary
in a later LLVM pass.</p>
<p>For scalar operations, LLVM already contains passes to do this. But it does
not seem to for vectors, possibly because OpenCL does not have C-like
promotion rules for vectors. CM does have C-like promotion rules for vectors,
so we need to cope with unnecessarily promoted operations.</p>
<div class="section" id="operation-of-the-pass">
<h4>Operation of the pass<a class="headerlink" href="#operation-of-the-pass" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>First it does a backwards scan, spotting where an instruction can be
converted to a smaller int size because its result is used in other
instructions that only use the lower part of the value (trunc, or an “and”
with e.g. 0xff). The modified instruction with a smaller int size then
needs a trunc inserting for each operand. When the pass reaches the
instruction that is the input to that new trunc, it may be able to
modify that one too. Thus a reduced int size gets propagated backwards.</p>
<p>Then it does a forwards scan, spotting where an instruction can be converted
to a smaller int size because the operands have only the lower part of the
value set (zext/sext, or an “and” with e.g. 0xff). The modified instruction with
a smaller int size then needs a ZExt/SExt inserting. Thus the reduced int size
is propagated forwards.</p>

<p>This pass checks that the use of SIMD control flow (llvm.genx.simdcf.goto
and llvm.genx.simdcf.join) conforms to the rules required to allow us to
generate actual goto and join instructions. If not, the intrinsics are
lowered to code that implements the defined semantics for the intrinsics,
but does not use SIMD CF instructions, so is usually less efficient.</p>
<p>It also makes certain transformations to make goto/join legal in terms of its
position in the basic block. These can fail silently, in which case the
conformance check will fail on the goto/join in question:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A goto and its extractvalues must be at the end of the block. (Actually, if
the !any result of the goto is used in a conditional branch at the end of
the block, then the goto being baled into the branch means that it is
treated as being at the end of the block anyway. The only reason we need
to sink it here is to ensure that isGotoBlock works.)</li>
<li>For a join label block (a block that is the JIP of other gotos/joins), a
join must come at the start of the block.</li>
<li>For a branching join block (one whose conditional branch condition is the
!any result from a join), the join must be at the end of the block.</li>
<li>For a block that has one join with both of the above true, we need to move
all other code out of the block.</li>
</ul>
<p>The pass is run twice: an “early SIMD CF conformance pass” (a module pass)
just before GenXLowering, and a “late SIMD CF conformance pass” (a function
group pass) just before second baling.</p>
<p>The early pass is the one that checks for conformance, and lowers the goto
and join intrinsics if the code is not conformant. The conformance checks
implement the rules listed in the documentation for the goto and join
intrinsics.</p>
<p>Lowering a goto issues a “failed to optimize SIMD control flow” warning. No
clue is given in the warning as to what caused the conformance failure,
however you (a compiler developer) can find out (for a test case submitted
by a compiler user) by turning on -debug and looking at the output from this
pass.</p>
<p>The late pass checks again for conformance, but if the code is not
conformant, it just errors. We could lower the gotos and joins there too,
but it would be more fiddly as we would have to ensure that the code
conforms with what is expected at that stage of compilation, and there is
no further chance to optimize it there.</p>
<p>We are not expecting this error to happen.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the late pass sets the register category of the EM and RM values
to “EM” and “RM”, so they do not get any register allocated.</p>

<ol class="arabic">

<li>by an insertvalue as part of a return value struct;</li>
<li>as the return value of a non-intrinsic call (perhaps as part of a struct),
as long as there is also a call arg that is an EM value, and the called

<p>GenXLowering is a function pass that lowers certain LLVM IR instructions
that the rest of the GenX backend cannot deal with, or to implement peephole
optimizations.</p>
<p>It also performs a few other tasks:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">It implements add sinking for a variable index in a region/element
access. This ensures that, in a sequence of operations to calculate a
variable index for a region/element access, any add constant is sunk to
the end, such that it can become a constant offset in an indirect
operand, and give GenXAddressCommoning more chance to common up address
calculations.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">It splits struct values where possible, by splitting all struct phi nodes
before running the main pass, then removing an extractvalue by using the
corresponding insertvalue’s input instead. Any struct value used as an arg
or return value still remains, and needs to be dealt with by register
allocation.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">It widens some byte vector operations to short vector.</p>
<p>Gen has restrictions on byte operands. The jitter copes with that, but
sometimes it needs to do even-odd splitting, which can lead to suboptimal
code if cmps and predicates are involved.
Here we attempt to pick up the common cases by converting a byte operation
to short.</p>
<p>Note that we might end up with the extends being baled into the instruction
anyway, resulting in a byte operation in vISA.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Certain uses of shufflevector are lowered:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>a splat (copy of one element across a vector);</li>
<li>a boolean slice (extract of a subvector) becomes rdpredregion;</li>
<li>a boolean unslice (insert subvector) becomes wrpredregion.</li>
</ol>
<p>Other uses of shufflevector are not expected and cause an assertion.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">A Trunc is lowered to a bitcast then a region/element read with a stride.
GenXCoalescing will coalesce the bitcast, and possibly bale in the region
read, so this will hopefully save an instruction or two.</p>

overflowing arithmetic intrinsics are not allowed by the GenX backend anyway.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IR restriction</strong>: No simd16 gather4_typed/scatter4_typed – they have been
split into 2x simd8 operations.</p>
<p><strong>IR restriction</strong>: rdpredregion intrinsic (which is generated by this pass from

<p><strong>IR restriction</strong>: wrpredregion intrinsic (which is generated by this pass from
certain cases of shufflevector, and represents the write of part of a predicate)
must have a compare as its “new value” input.</p>

<p>GenX instruction baling is the process of determining which LLVM instructions
can be combined into a single vISA instruction. Such a group of LLVM
instructions is known as a <em>bale</em>. A bale typically has a <em>main instruction</em>
and then optionally modifiers and region instructions on the sources and
the destination of the main instruction. However it is possible to have a
bale with no main instruction, for example just a rdregion, a modifier and
a wrregion.</p>
<div class="section" id="bale-example">
<h4>Bale example<a class="headerlink" href="#bale-example" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<img alt="_images/GenXDesign_bale.png" src="_images/GenXDesign_bale.png" />
<p>This example shows a bale that is pretty much as complicated as you can get in
a single bale. Each small blue box is an LLVM IR instruction, with arrows showing
how each one is used. Other than the <em>bale head</em> instruction at the top, an
instruction in a bale has only one use, which is within the bale.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-baling-pass">
<h4>The baling pass<a class="headerlink" href="#the-baling-pass" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>GenX instruction baling happens in two parts:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">The GenXBaling pass sets up a map to give each Instruction
a <em>BaleInfo</em>, which contains a field giving the role the instruction
plays in its enclosing bale (main instruction, rdregion, etc), and a
bit vector where a bit is set if the corresponding operand of the
instruction is another instruction that is baled in (part of the same
bale).</p>
<p>GenXBaling is in fact two slightly different passes run at two different
times:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The GenXFuncBaling pass (a FunctionPass) runs before GenXLegalization,
which uses it but invalidates it as it changes the code. This is known
as <em>first baling</em>.</li>
<li>The GenXGroupBaling pass (a FunctionGroupPass) runs after GenXLiveness.
From GenXLiveness, baling information remains valid through to
GenXVisaFunctionWriter, since any code changes made (such as adding
copies where coalescing fails) either do not invalidate the analysis,
or the pass making the change also updates the baling analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p>The GenXBaling pass also detects where an instruction is baled in to
another, but the instruction has other uses too. In this case it clones the
instruction. Thus we end up with any baled in instruction having only
one use (with an exception for goto/join – see below).</p>
<p>Thus the GenXBaling pass is not a pure analysis, as it can modify the
code.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Using the map set up by the GenXBaling analysis, several functions are

<h4>Criteria for baling<a class="headerlink" href="#criteria-for-baling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>GenXBaling implements the criteria for baling, i.e. when different LLVM IR
instructions can be combined into the same vISA instruction:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A rdregion with a variable index can bale in an add constant (where the
constant is splatted if vector) that generates the index. In second baling,
the constant add is in fact a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">llvm.genx.add.addr</span></code> intrinsic, because that
is what GenXCategory converted it to.</li>
<li>GenXBaling is where an instruction gets recognized as a modifier, for example
subtract from 0 is a negate modifier. The instruction is left as it is, and
its modifier equivalent (e.g. <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">BaleInfo::NEGMOD</span></code>) is set up in the
instruction’s BaleInfo.</li>
<li>SExt/ZExt are also treated as modifiers, although not always balable. See
below.</li>
<li>A modifier can bale in an rdregion.</li>
<li>A modifier can bale in another modifier in some circumstances.</li>
<li>In particular, SExt/ZExt normally cannot bale in another modifier, but they
are allowed to bale in an abs modifier as a bodge to fix a problem where
the LLVM IR generated for <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cm_abs</span></code> does not properly represent its
semantics. See <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dc93b907</span> <span class="pre">GenXBaling:</span> <span class="pre">bodge</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">work</span> <span class="pre">around</span> <span class="pre">cm_abs</span> <span class="pre">problems</span></code>.</li>
<li>A main instruction can bale a modifier or rdregion into each operand in some
circumstances:<ul>
<li>Some ALU intrinsics have region requirements, e.g. oword aligned,
contiguous. GenXBaling enforces those requirements by only baling in an
rdregion that satifies them, but only in second baling. First baling does
the baling anyway, as we want GenXLegalization to consider the instructions
as one bale as it might legalize in a way that makes the region legal for
the instruction.</li>
<li>Baling an SExt/ZExt in is how we represent a vISA instruction such as
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">add</span></code> with a result type different to operand type. The two operands can
have different types too in Gen, but vISA insists they are the same (if not
constant). So:<ol class="arabic">
<li>In first baling, we allow SExt/ZExt from different types to be baled in
to the two operands. This tends to make GenXLegalization legalize them
to the same vector width as the main instruction.</li>
<li>In second baling, we do not allow SExt/ZExt from different types (or one
SExt/ZExt where the other operand does not have one) to be baled in. This
yields a legal vISA instruction, but having done (1) also allows the
finalizer to fold the extend into the instruction.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>A raw operand (of a send or shared function intrinsic) has its own
restrictions – it can bale in a rdregion, but the region has to be
contiguous and GRF aligned.</li>
<li>There is special case code for where send or a shared function intrinsic
has a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">TWOADDR</span></code> raw operand, one that does not appear as a vISA operand
in its own right but is implicitly the same register as the result. The
twoaddr raw operand can bale in a rdregion (with region contiguous and GRF
aligned) as long as the result can be baled into a wrregion with the same
region parameters and the same “old value” input. This represents where a
send or shared function intrinsic does a predicated partial write, and the
place it does the partial write to is a region in a vISA register.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">llvm.genx.sat</span></code> represents floating point saturation, and is a modifier that
is different to the other modifiers because it is not a source modifier. A
saturate can bale in a main instruction or modifier or rdregion.</li>
<li>A wrregion can do the following baling:<ul>
<li>It can bale a main instruction (subject to region restrictions in second
baling), a saturate, a modifier or a rdregion into its “new value” input.</li>
<li>Like rdregion, it can bale a constant add into its index operand.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Anything with a predicate (wrregion, select, send, all/any, some shared
function intrinsics) can bale in a predicate not, and any of those things,
including the not, can bale in an rdpredregion to represent using e.g. an M3
flag to use only part of the predicate. However predicate baling is not
done in first baling, as GenXLegalization does not want to consider the
operations together.</li>
<li>Anything with a scalar i1 condition (select, br) can bale in an all/any.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="baling-of-goto-join-into-br">
<h4>Baling of goto/join into br<a class="headerlink" href="#baling-of-goto-join-into-br" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The goto and join intrinsics have multiple return values, returned in a single
struct. One of the return values is the scalar i1 !any value that is then used
in a conditional branch.</p>
<p>In second baling, we want the goto/join, the extractvalue of the !any
result, and the conditional branch to be baled together, so we can generate
a single goto/join instruction.</p>
<p>However the struct result of the goto/join has other uses, the extractvalues of
the other results. Thus, in this special case, we have a bale where the
goto/join instruction inside the bale has uses other than the inside-bale use.
This needs special case code to handle in GenXBaling.</p>
<p>In the future it may be worth considering a generalization of this idea of a
bale that is not a strict tree of instructions, so that we can use LLVM IR
to model Gen instructions with a general result and a flag result. Currently
we cannot do that, which means:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>we cannot represent addc properly;</li>
<li>we cannot represent any combined arithmetic-and-set-flags instruction,
although that is not too much of a problem as the jitter derives such an
instruction by folding a cmp into an arithmetic instruction.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="alignment-requirements">
<h4>Alignment requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#alignment-requirements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>An additional function of the second baling pass is that, when it bales a
raw result intrinsic into a wrregion, it marks the wrregion’s LiveRange as
needing to be 32 aligned, and when it bales a rdregion into a raw operand in
an intrinsic, it marks the rdregion’s input’s LiveRange as needing to be 32
aligned. GenXCategory sets most alignment requirements, but baling in
a rdregion or baling a main instruction into a wrregion imposes alignment
requirements on the vISA register that the region is read from or written to.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="genxlegalization">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id28">GenXLegalization</a><a class="headerlink" href="#genxlegalization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>GenXLegalization is a function pass that splits vector instructions
up to make execution widths legal, and to ensure that the GRF crossing rules
are satisfied.</p>
<p>This pass makes the LLVM IR closer to legal vISA by
splitting up any instruction that has an illegal vector width (too big or non
power of two) or an illegal region (illegal vstride/width/stride or illegal GRF
crossing).</p>
<p><strong>IR restriction</strong>: After this pass, LLVM IR represents vISA instructions
with legal execution width and region parameters, and with any particular
instruction’s region restrictions adhered to.</p>
<p>The pass uses the instruction baling information to tell which
regions an instruction has. Splitting an instruction and its regions needs to
be done with reference to all the regions at the same time, as they may need
splitting at different points.</p>
<p>For general values, an illegal width instruction is split by
creating narrower instructions, each of which uses a rdregion to extract the
subregion for each source operand, and then uses a wrregion to insert the
resulting subregion into the original destination value. The original illegal
width values survive, and that is OK because a vISA register can have any
vector width.</p>
<p>The pass uses the hasIndirectGRFCrossing feature from GenXSubtarget when
calculating whether a region is legal, or how a region needs to be split, in
the case that the region is indirect.</p>
<p>The legalization pass considers a bale of instructions as a separate
entity which can be split without reference to other bales. This works because
the overhead of splitting, which is an extra rdregion per operand and an extra
wrregion on the result, is pretty much free in that these extra region accesses
are baled in to the split instruction.</p>
<p>There are some cases where we decide we need to unbale an instruction, i.e.
remove it (or rather the subtree of instructions in the bale rooted at it)
from the bale, and then re-start the analysis for the bale. This happens
when there are two conflicting requirements in the bale, for example a main
instruction that needs at least simd4 but a rdregion that can only manage
simd2.</p>
<p>The pass scans backwards through the code, which makes this unbaling a bit
easier. An unbaled instruction will be encountered again a bit later, and
be processed as its own bale.</p>
<p>If a source operand being split is already an rdregion, then that rdregion is
split, so the new split rdregions read from the original rdregion’s input.</p>
<p>Similarly, if the bale is already headed by an wrregion, it is replaced by
the new split wrregions used to join the splits back together.</p>
<p>BitCast is not split in this pass. A non-category-converting BitCast is
always coalesced in GenXCoalescing, so never generates actual code. Thus it
does not matter if it has an illegal size.</p>
<div class="section" id="predicate-legalization">
<h4>Predicate legalization<a class="headerlink" href="#predicate-legalization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Predicates (vector of i1) are more complex. A general vISA value can be any
vector width, but a predicate can only be a power of two up to 32. Thus the
actual predicate values need to be split, not just the reads from and writes
to the values.</p>
<p>Furthermore, although it is possible to read and write a region within a
predicate, using H1/H2/Q1..Q4 flags, there are restrictions: the start
offset must be 8 aligned (4 aligned for a select or cmp with 64-bit
operands), and the size must be no more than the misalignment of the start
offset (e.g. for a start offset of 8, the size can be 8 but not 16).</p>
<p>So this pass splits an arbitrary size predicate value (including predicate phi
nodes) into as many as possible 32 bit parts, then descending power of two parts.
For example, a predicate of size 37 is split into 32,4,1.</p>
<p>Then, within each part, a read or write of the predicate can be further split
as long as it fits the restrictions above, e.g. a 32 bit part can be read/written
in 8 or 16 bit subregions.</p>
<p>This is achieved in two steps:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Predicates take part in the main code of GenXLegalization. When deciding how
to split a read or write of a predicate, we determine how the predicate value
will be split into parts (e.g. the 37 split into 32,4,1 example above), then
decides how a part could be subregioned if necessary (e.g. the 32 could have
a 16 aligned 16 bit region, or an 8 aligned 8 bit region). As well as a
maximum, this usually gives a minimum size region. If the rest of the bale
cannot achieve that minimum size, then we unbale to avoid the problem and
restart the analysis of the bale.</li>
<li>Then, fixIllegalPredicates() actually divides the illegally sized
predicate values, including phi nodes. The splitting in the main part of
GenXLegalization ensures that no read or write of a predicate value
crosses a part boundary, so it is straightforward to split the values into
those parts.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is complicated by the case that the IR before legalization has an
rdpredregion. This typically happens when a CM select has odd size operands
but an i32 mask. Clang codegen bitcasts the i32 mask to v32i1, then does a
shufflevector to extract the correct size predicate. GenXLowering turns the
shufflevector into rdpredregion. The main code in GenXLegalization splits the
rdpredregion into several rdpredregions.</p>
<p>In that case, we cannot guarantee that fixIllegalPredicates will find legal
rdpredregions. For example, suppose the original rdpredregion has a v32i1 as
input, and v13i1 as result. It is determined that the 13 bit predicate will
be split into 8,4,1 parts. The main GenXLegalization code will generate
an rdpredregion from the 32 bit predicate for each part of the 13 bit
predicate. However, the rdpredregion for the 1 bit part is illegal, because
its start offset is not 8 aligned.</p>
<p>We currently do not cope with that (it will probably assert somewhere). If we
do find a need to cope with it, then the illegal rdpredregion will need to be
lowered to bit twiddling code.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="other-tasks-of-genxlegalization">
<h4>Other tasks of GenXLegalization<a class="headerlink" href="#other-tasks-of-genxlegalization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>An additional task of this pass is to lower an any/all intrinsic that is
used anywhere other than as the predicate of a scalar wrregion by inserting
such a scalar wrregion with a byte 0/1 result and then a compare of that
to give an i1.</p>
<p>A further task of this pass is to lower any predicated wrregion where the
value to write is a vector wider than 1 but the predicate is a scalar i1 (other
than the value 1, which means unpredicated). It inserts code to splat the
scalar i1 predicate to v16i1 or v32i1. This is really part of lowering, but
we need to do it here because in GenXLowering the value to write might be
wider than 32.</p>
<p>An extra optimization performed in this pass is to transform a move (that
is, a lone wrregion or lone rdregion or a rdregion+wrregion baled together)
with a byte element type into the equivalent short or int move. This saves
the jitter having to split the byte move into even and odd halves. This
optimization needs to be done when baling info is available, so legalization
is a handy place to put it.</p>

<p>GenXLiveness is an analysis that contains the liveness information for the

are in LLVM IR rather than machine IR.</p>
<p>This GenXLiveness pass is a container for the data structures required
for liveness analysis, plus methods to perform the analysis. The pass itself
does nothing; later passes manipulate it:</p>
<ul class="simple">

<li>GenXLiveRanges calls GenXLiveness to set up the LiveRange for each
value that needs one (a non-baled instruction or a function argument),
and erases the LiveRange for a value that does not need one (a baled

</ul>
<p>GenXLiveness is a FunctionGroupPass, because we want to share liveness
information between all the Functions in a FunctionGroup (i.e. between a
GenX kernel/function and its subroutines). Any pass that uses GenXLiveness,
which is almost all passes that run after it, must itself be a
FunctionGroupPass.</p>

<h4>SimpleValue<a class="headerlink" href="#simplevalue" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Liveness information deals with SimpleValues rather than Values.
SimpleValue (a GenX backend specific class) is the entity that can have
a live range attached and a register allocated. A SimpleValue is either a
non-struct Value, or a non-struct element of a struct Value (where the
struct can contain nested structs).</p>
<p>A SimpleValue is represented by a pair:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>a Value *</li>
<li>a flattened index for a non-struct element of a struct, otherwise 0</li>
</ul>
<p>Having a flattened index (as generated by IndexFlattener::flatten()) allows
us to encode an element in multiply nested structs with a single index.</p>
<p>The idea of SimpleValue is that, where the LLVM IR contains a struct value,
which is unavoidable when a function has multiple return values, we want
to allocate a register to each non-struct element, not the whole struct.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="segments">
<h4>Segments<a class="headerlink" href="#segments" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>A live range consists of one or more non-overlapping <em>segments</em>, where each
segment has a start (inclusive) and end (exclusive) instruction number, and a
strength, which is strong (normal), weak (see below) or phicpy (see below).
Two segments cannot be abutting if they have the same
strength. Later passes can interrogate this information to find out whether
two live ranges interfere, and can modify it by coalescing (merging) two
live ranges. After coalescing, multiple SimpleValues share the same live
range.</p>
<p>The numbering of instructions is handled in GenXNumbering.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="weak-liveness">
<h4>Weak liveness<a class="headerlink" href="#weak-liveness" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>A live range that extends over a call has the entire range of the called
subroutine, and any subroutines it can call, added to it. This makes that
live range interfere with any live range inside the subroutine, and thus
stops them using the same register.</p>
<p>However, because a subroutine has a single range in instruction numbering,
rather than one range per call site, this scheme means that two values A
and B that are live over two <em>different</em> call sites of the same subroutine
both include the subroutine’s range, and thus look like they interfere.
This could stop A and B being coalesced, and thus add extra code and
register pressure.</p>
<p>To fix this, we have the concept of <em>weak liveness</em>. The values A and B
are only weakly live inside the subroutine. Two values are considered to
interfere only if there is some point where both are live, and at least
one of them is not weakly live at that point.</p>
<p>Thus, in our A and B example, A and B each interferes with any value inside
the subroutine, but not with each other.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="phicpy-liveness">
<h4>Phicpy liveness<a class="headerlink" href="#phicpy-liveness" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>A phi node has a short segment of liveness (a <em>phicpy segment</em>) at the end
of each of its incoming blocks, from the phi copy insertion point up to the
end of the block. The use of the incoming value in the phi node is counted
as being at that phi copy insertion point.</p>
<p>Normally, we split critical edges, so an incoming block to a phi node has
only the one successor, and the use of the incoming value at the phi copy
insertion point is a kill use. Often, the phi node and the incoming can be
coalesced, unless there is some interference elsewhere due to other values
previously coalesced into the two live ranges.</p>
<p>However, in one case (a goto/join branching to a join), we cannot split the
critical edge. Thus the phi copy insertion point is before the conditional
branch in a block with two successors, and the incoming value is likely to
be used in the other successor too. Then, there is interference between the
phi node and the incoming value, even though they could be coalesced.</p>
<p>To avoid this problem, each phicpy segment in a live range is marked as
such. A phicpy segment is valid only if there is no segment abutting it
before; if there is an abutting before segment, the coalescing code turns it
into a normal strong segment and merges the two together.</p>
<p>Then, interference between two live ranges LR1 and LR2 is ignored if:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>the interference arises between a phicpy segment in LR1 and a normal
(strong) segment in LR2; and</li>
<li>the start of the phicpy segment is the phi copy insertion point where the
phi node is in LR1 and the incoming value is in LR2.</li>
</ol>
<p>This then allows the incoming value and the phi node to be coalesced, even
if the incoming value is also used in the branch’s other successor.</p>

this pass mops those up.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">It resolves each overlapping circular phi value.</p>
<p>LLVM IR does not attach
any importance to the order of phi nodes in any particular basic block.
At the head of a loop, a phi incoming can also be a phi definition in the
same block, and they could be in either order.</p>
<p>However, once we start constructing live ranges in the GenX backend, we
attach importance to the order of the phi nodes, so we need to resolve
any such overlapping circular phi value. Currently we do this by
inserting a copy (actually a bitcast) just after the phi nodes in that
basic block. A future enhancement would be to try and re-order the phi
nodes, and only fall back to copy insertion if there is circularity and
it is impossible to find a correct order, for example when the loop body
swaps two variables over.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">It inserts a load for any operand that is constant but not allowed to be.
It also catches any case where constant propagation in EarlyCSE has

<li><p class="first">It determines the register category and increased alignment requirement

<p>All this pass inserts is a llvm.genx.convert intrinsic. It does not record
what the categories are. This information is recalculated in GenXLiveness.</p>
<p>The reason for inserting the convert intrinsic calls here, before the final
run of GenXBaling before GenXLiveRanges, is that we want GenXBaling to spot
when a convert intrinsic can be baled with rdregion or wrregion.</p>
<p>For one value (function argument or instruction), the pass looks at the
categories required for the defintion and each use. If there is no address
conversion involved, then it inserts a single conversion if possible (all
uses are the same category), otherwise it inserts a conversion for each use
that requires one.</p>
<p><strong>IR restriction</strong>: After this pass, a value must have its def and all uses

<div class="section" id="address-conversion">
<h4>Address conversion<a class="headerlink" href="#address-conversion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>An address conversion is treated slightly differently.</p>
<p>A rdregion/wrregion representing an indirect region has a variable index.
This index is actually an index, whereas the vISA we need to generate for
it uses an address register that has been set up with an <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">add_addr</span></code>
instruction from the index and the base register.</p>
<p>This pass inserts an <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">llvm.genx.convert.addr</span></code> intrinsic, with zero offset,
to represent the conversion from index to address register. However, the
intrinsic has no way of representing the base register.  Instead, the base
register is implicitly the “old value” input of the rdregion/wrregion where
the address is used.</p>
<p>The same index may well be used in multiple rdregions and wrregions,
especially after LLVM’s CSE. But at this stage we have no idea whether
these multiple rdregions/wrregions will have the same base register, so
we must assume not and insert a separate <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">llvm.genx.convert.addr</span></code>
for each rdregion/wrregion use of the index.</p>
<p>These multiple address conversions of the same index are commoned up
where possible later on in GenXAddressCommoning. That pass runs after
GenXCoalescing, so it can tell whether two address conversions of the
same index also have the same base register because the “old value”
inputs of the regions have been coalesced together.</p>
<p>Where an index used in an indirect region is a constant add, this pass
inserts the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">llvm.genx.convert.addr</span></code> before that, and turns the constant
add into <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">llvm.genx.add.addr</span></code>. The latter can be baled into rdregion
or wrregion, representing a constant offset in the indirect region.
Only one <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">llvm.genx.add.addr</span></code> is allowed between the
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">llvm.genx.convert.addr</span></code> and the use in a rdregion/wrregion.</p>
<p>However this pass does not check whether the offset is in range (although
GenXBaling does check that before deciding to bale it in). The
GenXAddressCommoning pass sorts that out.</p>
<p><strong>IR restriction</strong>: After this pass, a variable index in a rdregion/wrregion

<p>After live range building, GenXUnbaling spots cases where baling is harmful
due to extending the live range of a big vector.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-need-for-the-unbaling-pass">
<h4>The need for the unbaling pass<a class="headerlink" href="#the-need-for-the-unbaling-pass" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>A <em>two address operation</em> (mainly wrregion, but also a few intrinsics that
do a predicated read from a shared function unit such as memory) is one
where the result needs to be in the same register as one operand, the <em>two
address operand</em>. GenXCoalescing attempts to coalesce the two together, but
it fails if the live range of the two address operand extends beyond the
two address instruction. Failure of coalescing means that you get extra
code inserted before to copy the whole big vector, and increased register
pressure because two values of the big vector are live at the same time.</p>
<p>Similarly, with a phi node incoming, GenXCoalescing attempts to coalesce
the incoming with the phi node result. Failure means that you get extra
code inserted to copy the value at the end of the incoming block.</p>
<p>The existence of this problem is due to our use of SSA. Both the input and
the output of the wrregion (or the phi incoming and result) are probably
the same big vector variable in the source code, and a more traditional
compiler would treat the variable as a single (non-SSA) value assigned to
its own register, avoiding the need to treat the wrregion specially as a
two address operation.</p>
<p>With the traditional approach, code motion is more difficult, as an
instruction cannot be moved past any other instruction that modifies any of
the potentially moving instruction’s uses.</p>
<p>With our SSA approach, code motion (of an instruction with no memory
interaction) is much easier, and we use that in GenXBaling to bale an
instruction into another one without needing to check anything in between.
(Even though GenXBaling often does not actually move the baled in
instruction in IR, it must be treated as if it is at the position of the
head of the bale.)</p>
<p>The price we pay for that flexibility is that sometimes we move code even
when it is harmful to do so.</p>
<p>The most common situation where it would fail to coalesce is where
legalization has created a sequence of wrregions, and the “old value” input
to the first one is also used in a rdregion baled in to each one of the
wrregions.</p>
<p>Other situations include where some other rdregion use of the two address
operand is user code that has been baled to after the instruction, and
where the user code actually takes a copy of the big vector and then uses
one or more regions out of it after the two address instruction.</p>
<p>The GenXUnbaling pass implements two transformations: the non-overlapping
region optimization, and the unbaling transformation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="non-overlapping-region-optimization">
<h4>Non-overlapping region optimization<a class="headerlink" href="#non-overlapping-region-optimization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>A common cause of the two address operand, the “old value” input, of a
wrregion extending beyond the wrregion is that the wrregion is the first in
a sequence created by GenXLegalization, and the same vector is used as an
input to rdregions baled in to subsequent bales in the sequence.</p>
<p>In this case, a baled in rdregion is reading a part of the vector that has
not been overwritten by any earlier wrregion in the sequence.</p>
<p>The non-overlapping region optimization detects this case by checking which
regions of the vector have been overwritten by earlier wrregions in the
sequence. If the region read by the rdregion has not been overwritten, then
the optimization can change the input to the rdregion to the result of the
previous wrregion in the sequence without changing the semantics.</p>
<p>If this succeeds for all the rdregions from the same vector in the
sequence, then the live range no longer reaches beyond the first wrregion
and it can be two address coalesced.</p>
<p>The non-overlapping region optimization also handles a similar case where
the “old value” input to the first wrregion in the sequence is undef, but
of the same type as the input to rdregions through the sequence. As well as
modifying each rdregion input to the result of the previous wrregion, it
changes the undef input to the first wrregion to the same input vector.
This also stops the live range of the inputs to the rdregions overlapping
the result, and thus saves register pressure. However it can make the code
worse if there are further uses of the input after the sequence, so it only
makes the transformation if there are no further uses.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="unbaling-transformation">
<h4>Unbaling transformation<a class="headerlink" href="#unbaling-transformation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>At its simplest, the unbaling transformation looks at each two address
instruction and phi node incoming, and then looks at the uses of the “old
value” input:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A use before the original two address instruction can be ignored as it
does not cause the “old value” input to be live beyond that instruction.</li>
<li>A use after the original two address instruction that is not a rdregion
cannot be handled, so causes the pass to abandon processing this original
two address operation.</li>
<li>A rdregion use after the original two address instruction is unbaled so
it regains its pre-baling position before the original two address
instruction.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus the use of the “old value” input in the two address instruction
becomes a kill use, and coalescing at that instruction will succeed. Or the
phi incoming becomes a kill use, and coalescing it with the phi result will
succeed.</p>
<p>But there are complications:</p>
<div class="section" id="moving-the-unbaled-instruction">
<h5>Moving the unbaled instruction<a class="headerlink" href="#moving-the-unbaled-instruction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Unbaling an instruction means that its position in the code is now
considered to be the same as its position in the IR. Sometimes that is
where we want it (before the original two address instruction), since
baling tends not to move code. But sometimes it is still after the original
two address instruction, most likely because of the order of code split by
GenXLegalization.</p>
<p>Thus we may need to move the unbaled instruction up to before the original
two address instruction. In fact we need to move the whole sub-bale (the
new bale headed by the instruction we are unbaling). A rdregion can have an
llvm.genx.add.address intrinsic baled in if it has a variable index.</p>
<p>If the unbaled instruction is dominated by the original two address
instruction, we move it to just before that. Otherwise, we move it to the
end of the basic block that is the nearest common dominator of the two
locations.</p>
<p>To move a bale up, we need to ensure that all outside-bale operands are
defined before where we are going to move it to. If that is not the case,
then unbaling for the original two address instruction fails.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="moving-when-there-is-a-variable-index">
<h5>Moving when there is a variable index<a class="headerlink" href="#moving-when-there-is-a-variable-index" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>For a rdregion with a variable index, there is an llvm.genx.conv.address
intrinsic, which represents the setting of an address register relative to
the base register that the rdregion will access. GenXCategory ensures that
there is one llvm.genx.conv.address intrinsic for each variable index
rdregion or wrregion, since it does not know which region accesses are
going to be in the same register. Commoning up of address conversions is
done later, after coalescing has decided which ones are in the same base
register.</p>
<p>The problem for GenXUnbaling is that the llvm.genx.conv.address is likely
to be just before the rdregion, which stops the rdregion being moved to
before the original two address instruction.</p>
<p>The solution is to pretend that the llvm.genx.conv.address (and anything it
bales in, probably a zext/sext) is part of the rdregion’s bale, just for
GenXUnbaling’s purposes of telling whether it is OK to move it, and then
actually moving it. GenXBaling::buildBale() has an extra IncludeAddr flag
to enable this behavior.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-is-before-and-after">
<h5>What is before and after?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-before-and-after" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The notion of whether an instruction is before or after the original two
address instruction is more complex in the presence of control flow.</p>
<p>This pass distinguishes the following cases:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Before: The instruction dominates the original two address instruction,
so can be considered before it. No use in the instruction reaches back to
the original two address instruction.</li>
<li>After: The original two address instruction dominates the instruction, so
can be considered after it. A use in the instruction causes liveness to
reach back to the original two address instruction (as long as the use’s
definition is before that).</li>
<li>Reaches: Neither dominates the other, but a use in the instruction causes
liveness to reach back to the original two address instruction anyway.
This is determined by actually tracing back all the branches through the
control graph, abandoning a branch when it rejoins with another one or
reaches the definition.</li>
<li>Not reaches: Neither dominates the other, but we can prove that a use in
the instruction does not cause liveness to reach back to the original two
address instruction.</li>
</ul>
<p>When processing a phi incoming rather than a two address instruction, it is
considered to be at the end of the corresponding incoming block, rather
than at the site of the phi node.</p>
<p>If we have “not reaches”, then the use can be ignored in the same way as a
“before” use.</p>
<p>If we have “reaches”, then we can still unbale it. If the new sub-bale
needs moving, then we move it to the end of the block that is the nearest
common dominator of its old location and the original two address
instruction.</p>
<p>A use in a phi node is considered to be at the end of the incoming block
for the purposes of determining its position.</p>

<h5>Commoning up unbaled sub-bales<a class="headerlink" href="#commoning-up-unbaled-sub-bales" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>It is often the case that baling has caused the same rdregion to be cloned
(because a baled in instruction can only have a single use), so unbaling
the baled in rdregions causes duplicate instructions. No CSE is run after
this point, as that would cause various problems including messing up the
baling and the address conversion.</p>
<p>Therefore, this pass needs to spot when it is unbaling duplicate sub-bales
and common them up.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="unbaling-the-main-instruction-instead-of-the-rdregion">
<h5>Unbaling the main instruction instead of the rdregion<a class="headerlink" href="#unbaling-the-main-instruction-instead-of-the-rdregion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>In some cases, the rdregion is in a bale that also contains another
rdregion of the same big vector. Unbaling the two rdregions separately
would create two extra instructions. We can reduce that to one extra
instruction by instead unbaling the main instruction from the wrregion at
the head, so only the wrregion is left at its original position in the code
and the rest of the bale is moved up.</p>
<p>The pass only does that if it detects more than one use of the big vector
in the bale.</p>
<p>When trying to do this, and the proposed sub-bale needs to be moved rather
than just unbaled, we may see that not all outside-bale operands are
defined before the original two address instruction. In that case, we
abandon the attempt to unbale the main instruction, and instead go back to
unbaling just the rdregion, which may succeed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="bitcasts">
<h5>Bitcasts<a class="headerlink" href="#bitcasts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Because GenXCoalescing does “copy coalescing” of bitcasts first, we need to
consider not just the rdregion uses of the input to the original two
address instruction, but also uses of the whole tree of bitcasts containing
it. Not doing that stops the optimization working when the source CM code
contains format() functions.</p>
<p>Such bitcasts may need to be moved up to just before the original two
address instruction, in case any use of it is moved. In fact we just move
the whole tree of bitcasts to just after the definition of the root of the
tree.  This does not worsen code quality because the bitcasts will all be
copy coalesced together anyway.</p>

<p>GenXDepressurizer is a pass that identifies where register pressure is
excessive, and attempts to sink and/or clone definitions past that area to
reduce register pressure.</p>
<p>Currently the pass is enabled to handle only flag (predicate) values. It is
supposed to work for general values, but that is not yet enabled and it may
require some bug fixing and fine tuning before it is.</p>
<p>In fact this pass is now viewed as a dead end. The plan to replace it is a
pass that does register allocation as if into Gen’s real registers, doing
live range splitting and rematerialization where required, to help undo the
register-pressure-increasing effects of CSE and LICM where it would cause a
spill.</p>
<p>The basic idea of the existing GenXDepressurizer pass:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Scan the code backwards, keeping track of what values are live and what
the register pressure is (total size of all live values, also the total
size for flag (predicate) values).</li>
<li>Where register pressure becomes excessive, look at currently live values
to see if any is a definition that could profitably be sunk to below the
current point.</li>
<li>Sink any such instructions until register pressure is no longer
excessive.</li>
<li>For a flag value, “profitably be sunk” includes the case that it
decreases flag register pressure but increases overall register pressure
(by, for instance, lengthening the live ranges of the inputs to a cmp),
but general register pressure is not high at the current point.</li>
<li>A flag value that does not require cloning (all uses are dominated by the
current point) is sunk anyway, as long as it does not push an already
high general pressure up higher.</li>
</ol>
<p>Point 5 means that this pass replaces GenXCodeSinking, which sank any single
use flag value.</p>
<p>There are some complications to the scheme:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>How do we scan code backwards in a way that keeps track of pressure when
there is control flow, particularly loops?</li>
<li>When considering a definition to sink, we need to know whether a
particular use is reachable from the current point, and whether it is
dominated by it.</li>

<h4>Backwards scanning order and pseudo CFG<a class="headerlink" href="#backwards-scanning-order-and-pseudo-cfg" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>In order to keep track of liveness and pressure as we scan backwards, we
want to scan the basic blocks in an order that ensures that we do not scan
a particular basic block until we have scanned all its successors.  In that
way we can easily gather the live out set of the basic block from the live
in of each successor, modified by the incoming for our block in the phi
nodes in the successor. (If there are phi nodes, there is only one
successor, because critical edges have been split.)</p>
<p>A loop needs special consideration. We want to scan all of the blocks of a
loop (including inner loops) in one go, after scanning all possible
successors of the loop, and before scanning the predecessor(s) of the loop

take account of</p>

<p>GenXNumbering is an analysis that provides a numbering of the instructions
for use by live ranges.</p>
<p>The numbering is done such that slots are reserved for where GenXCoalescing
might need to insert copies.</p>
<p>Generally, an instruction gets a slot in the numbering for itself, and
another slot just before, in case it is a two address instruction where
GenXCoalescing might want to insert a copy.</p>
<p>Every instruction gets a number, even if it is baled in. However, for the
purposes of live range segments, every instruction in a bale is assumed
to have the same number as the head instruction of the bale.</p>
<p>A non-intrinsic call has N slots reserved
before it for pre-copies, where N is the number of SimpleValues in the
(possibly struct) args, allowing for extra args that might be added later by
GenXArgIndirection.</p>
<p>Similarly, a non-intrinsic call has N slots reserved after it for
post-copies, where N is the number of SimpleValues in the (possibly struct)
return value. The definition of each SimpleValue in the result of the call
is considered to be in its slot, and the corresponding SimpleValue in the
unified return value has an extra segment of live range from the call up to
that slot.</p>
<p>A return instruction in a subroutine has N slots reserved before it for
pre-copies, where N is the number of SimpleValues in the (possibly struct)
return value. The use of each SimpleValue in the return is considered to be
in its slot, and the corresponding SimpleValue in the unified return value
has an extra segment of live range from the slot up to the return.</p>
<p>A kernel has a slot for each kernel arg copy. A copy is inserted into such a slot in
GenXCoalescing if the kernel arg offset is not aligned enough for the uses

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id50">GenXCoalescing</a><a class="headerlink" href="#genxcoalescing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The LLVM target independent code generator, used by most backends, has a
coalescing pass that runs after de-SSA of the machine IR and two-address
handling, and attempts to remove the added copies by coalescing values. It
also attempts to coalesce a value with a hardreg that it is copied to/from.</p>
<p>This GenX coalescing and copy insertion pass is a bit different, in that
it runs on LLVM IR, which must remain in SSA, and it attempts to coalesce
values to try and avoid adding the copy in the first place. In any phi node
or two address op where it fails to coalesce, it inserts a copy (and
coalesces the result of the copy into the result of the phi node or
two address op).</p>
<p>There are three different kinds of coalescing. Copy coalescing is done first,
then the other two are done together.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Copy coalescing.</p>
<p>Generally there are no copy instructions in SSA, but we
can treat a bitcast as a copy (the operand and result can live in the
same register aliased in different registers), and an extractvalue is
treated as a copy to be coalesced, and the “inserted value” operand
and the corresponding element(s) of the result in an insertvalue are
treated as a copy to be coalesced.</p>
<p>Copy coalescing represents two values that are known to be identical
occupying the same register at the same time, thus it is possible even
if the two values interfere (are live at the same point). Because we
handle copy coalescing before any other kind of coalescing, it usually
succeeds.</p>
<p>This only works because we do copy coalescing first, so we know that
neither value that we want to copy coalesce has already undergone normal
or phi coalescing.</p>
<p>However there is a case when copy coalescing between two live ranges
LR1 and LR2 (each of which is possibly already copy coalesced) cannot be
allowed: when LR2 loops round and has a phi use in the same basic block
as a phi definition in LR1, where the phi use of LR2 is after the phi
definition of LR1. This can happen because LLVM IR does not attach any
meaning to the order of phi nodes, but the GenX backend does with its
instruction numbering.</p>
<p>This constraint on copy coalescing is embodied in the concept of
“copy-interference”. The two live ranges LR1 and LR2 copy-interfere,
meaning they cannot be copy coalesced, if LR1 has a phi definition,
one of whose numbers is within LR2’s live range.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Normal coalescing</p>
<p>This arises where we have a two-address operation, that is, it has an
operand that needs to be in the same register as the result, because the
instruction represents a partial write operation. The main example of
this is wrregion, but there are also some shared function intrinsics
that need this.</p>
<p>Here, we gather all the possible coalesces (including the phi ones),
together with an estimate of the cost of failing to coalesce (due to
needing to insert a copy), and then sort them in cost order and process
them.</p>
<p>This kind of coalescing is possible only if the two live ranges do not
interfere. If coalescing fails, we need to insert a copy just before
the instruction, creating a new value with a very short live range
that can trivially be coalesced with the result of the original
instruction.</p>
<p>Some subkinds of normal coalescing are:</p>
<p>2a. call arg pre-copy</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>A call arg needs to be coalesced with or copied to the corresponding
function arg.</p>
<p>Unlike most other kinds of coalescing, if coalescing fails, the copy
insertion is delayed until later, so we can ensure that the copies
are in the same order as the args, as the live ranges were computed
on that basis.</p>
<p>Normally, call arg pre-copy coalescing occurs, like other normal
coalescing, if the two live ranges do not interfere. If this fails,
we can still do <em>call arg special coalescing</em> (CASC) of call arg A
and function arg B as long as both of the following are true:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="lowerroman simple">
<li>B has not been normal coalesced into anything (which would be
in the subroutine or some other subroutine it calls), except
that B is allowed to be call arg pre-copy coalesced;</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<ol class="lowerroman simple" start="2">
<li>For any other call site where the corresponding call arg is not
A, A does not interfere with it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Call arg special coalescing allows call arg A and function arg B to
be in the same register, even if A is used after the call, as long
as that register is not already being used for a different value
in the subroutine, and as long as a different value for the call
arg is not used at a different call site where A is live.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Call arg special coalescing is disabled, because it broke
a test and I never got round to investigating why. I don’t even know
if it would be beneficial any more, given more recent changes to
liveness and coalescing.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>2b. ret value pre-copy</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>At a ReturnInst, the return value operand needs to be coalesced with
or copied to the unified return value for the function. This is
handled mostly the same as a normal coalesce.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>2c. ret value post-copy</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>After a CallInst for a subroutine call, the unified return value
needs to be coalesced with or copied to the result of the call. On
failure, the copy insertion is delayed until later.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Phi coalescing</p>
<p>This is how we “de-SSA” the code. A phi incoming wants to coalesce with
the result of the phi node.</p>
<p>Again, this kind of coalescing is possible only if the two live ranges
do not interfere. (A phi incoming can never interfere with its phi
result, but earlier coalescing could make them now interfere.) If
coalescing fails, we need to insert a copy at the end of the incoming
predecessor basic block. In fact we defer the copy insertion from failed
phi coalescing to the end, because we need to make sure the inserted
copies are in the same order as the phi nodes, as that is the basis on
which the live ranges were constructed.</p>
<p>After phi coalescing, the LLVM IR is still in SSA form, but the phi
coalescing, and the copies inserted where phi coalescing failed, mean
that it is trivial to transform into non-SSA vISA code: generate code for
the phi copies, and ignore the phi nodes themselves because they are
completely coalesced.</p>

<div class="section" id="kernel-argument-copying">
<h4>Kernel argument copying<a class="headerlink" href="#kernel-argument-copying" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The kernel argument offsets (i.e. where kernel arguments appear in the GRF
on entry to the kernel) are set in a very early pass just after Clang
codegen. This sets offsets and packs holes in a way that is specific to the
language being compiled and its contract with its runtime.</p>
<p>However, when we get here, we may find that a live range that contains a
kernel argument has an alignment requirement that the offset from
earlier does not comply with.</p>
<p>So an extra function of this pass, after doing the coalescing, is to spot
this case, where a kernel argument has an offset that is not aligned enough,
and insert an extra copy at the start of the function.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id51">GenXAddressCommoning</a><a class="headerlink" href="#genxaddresscommoning" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This pass spots when multiple address conversions use the same value and
are used in regions with the same base register (the same coalesced live
range), and commons up the address conversions.</p>
<p>It also handles cases where an llvm.genx.add.addr has an out of range offset
that is not encodable as the constant offset in an indirect operand. When
commoning up address conversions, it groups ones with nearby offsets such
that all uses of a commoned address conversion have in range offsets in
their llvm.genx.add.addr ops.</p>
<p>Before this pass, GenXCategoryConversion has ensured that each use of a
variable index in an element or region access (llvm.genx.rdregion etc
intrinsics) has its own separate address conversion (llvm.genx.convert.addr
intrinsic). Any constant add/sub between the address conversion
and the use of the variable index has been turned into an llvm.genx.add.addr
intrinsic.</p>
<p>This GenXAddressCommoning pass spots when multiple address conversions
use the same index value as input and are used in element/region accesses
with the same base register. These can then be commoned up.</p>
<p>In fact, rather than looking at an address conversion in isolation, it needs
to look at the whole bale containing the address conversion, which might have
a baled in rdregion and modifiers. It needs to do this because
GenXBaling cloned the rdregion and modifiers, so they need commoning up
again with the address conversion.
This situation is common because GenXLowering lowers a trunc (as often
found in an index calculation to convert the index to i16) into a bitcast
and a rdregion.</p>
<p>A second transformation in this pass is the “histogram optimization”: If
there are multiple scalar address conversions for the same base reg where
each index is an extract (a scalar rdregion) from the same index vector, we
attempt to common them up into a vector address conversion, with an extract
from the result of the vector address conversion for each user of an
original scalar address conversion. The extract is baled in to the indirect
region, appearing as the “addr_offset” field (the index into the 8 wide
address register) in the generated vISA.</p>
<p>This histogram optimization uses the hasIndirectGRFCrossing feature from
GenXSubtarget to tell how big the combined vector address conversion can be,
in the case that it itself is an indirect region.</p>
<p>Both of the transformations in this pass are fiddly because the pass runs so
late. It has to run this late because we cannot tell whether address
conversions can be commoned up until GenXCoalescing has decided which vectors
are in the same register, but that then means that this pass has to update
live ranges and baling info for the code that it modifies.</p>
<p><strong>IR restriction</strong>: After this pass, the restrictions on
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">llvm.genx.convert.addr</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">llvm.genx.add.addr</span></code> having just a single
use are relaxed. Now, multiple uses of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">llvm.genx.convert.addr</span></code>, possibly
each via a single <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">llvm.genx.add.addr</span></code>, must be in rdregions/wrregions
where the base register is provably the same because all the values that
appear as the “old value” input are coalesced together into the same
LiveRange.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id52">GenXArgIndirection</a><a class="headerlink" href="#genxargindirection" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The GenXArgIndirection pass runs very late, after coalescing and address
commoning, to change arguments and return values that were originally by ref
to use address registers. This saves copies and register pressure.</p>
<p>Recall that, very early on in CMABI, a by ref argument is transformed into
copy-in copy-out semantics.</p>
<p>This pass is run very late on for two reasons:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">There is no convenient way to represent passing an argument using an
address register in LLVM IR. We don’t want to pretend that the address
register is a pointer, and the GRF is an area of memory, as that would
stop us using Values to represent registers normally, and so would stop
us using lots of LLVM optimizations.</p>
<p>Running the pass this late means that the IR afterwards does not have to
strictly represent the semantics, as nothing else happens to it before
generating the output code. So uses and defs of the indirected argument
(and other Values coalesced with it) still use the same Values, but that
live range has no register allocated (it is category NONE), and all
accesses are indirected.  We rely on the LLVM IR together with the
liveness information representing the code well enough for register
allocation and code generation to work.</p>

<h4>Action of GenXArgIndirection<a class="headerlink" href="#action-of-genxargindirection" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>An argument for a subroutine call can generate a bunch of mov instructions in
two circumstances:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Coalescing failed to coalesce this call argument, so the argument in the
caller and the argument in the subroutine are in different registers
(different coalesced live ranges). In this case, GenXCoalescing has to
generate a sequence of baled together rdregion-wrregion intrinsic pairs,
each generating a mov instruction, to copy the value.</li>
<li>The argument was originally a by ref CM select(), so is an rdregion,
legalized into a sequence of baled together rdregion-wrregion pairs.</li>
</ol>
<p>The argument indirection pass attempts to spot these cases. The regions at
each call site must be similar (same region parameters except start index)
and contiguous.</p>
<p>The pass modifies each call to pass an address register into the subroutine
as an extra argument, using it to indirecting all accesses to the subroutine
argument and other Values coalesced with it. It then removes the rd-wr
sequence so it does not generate any code.</p>
<p>Indirecting all accesses to the subroutine argument is only possible if each
one would be legal as an indirect region. The pass uses the
hasIndirectGRFCrossing feature from GenXSubtarget to tell whether it would
be legal. The optimization can fail for this reason, and that is more common
on pre-SKL where there is no indirect region GRF crossing.</p>
<p>The pass deals with one subroutine argument in one subroutine at a time. It
looks at all call sites to see if there is anything that stops this
transformation happening at all, and whether there is any call site that
would benefit from the transformation.</p>
